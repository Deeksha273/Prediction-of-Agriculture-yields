# Prediction-of-Agriculture-yields

** Comparison of regression models **
Random Forest regression demonstrated superior performance with accuracy of 97% rates and fast processing because it can capture non-linear correlations, manage high dimensional data, and avoid overfitting. Its ensemble nature enhances predictive accuracy by identifying diverse patterns in agricultural data, making it more robust to noise and outliers compared to Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and XGBoost.

**  Comparison of deep learning models and ensemble models **
An ensemble model that combined Random Forest and RNN was created to further improve yield forecast accuracy, and it produced a 96% accuracy rate. This hybrid technique increased predictive performance and resistance against data unpredictability by utilizing Random Forest's strength in feature selection and generalization and RNN's capacity to capture temporal dependencies.
